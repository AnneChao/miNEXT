The spider abundance data used in the code as an example were taken from Thorn et al. (2017); The birds incidnce data were taken from Thorn et al. (2016). 

The code includes four files: (1) Alpine data: relative abundances of 45 Alpine species (2) Alpine phylo_tree: phylogenetic tree of 45 Alpine species (3) Evenness.R: Main code for computing the profiles of six classess of evenness measures and species/node contribution to Jaccard- and Sorensen-type dissimilarity measures (4) Lorenz.R: R code for computing and plotting Lorenz curves of assemblages

More details will be given when Chao and Ricotta's evenness paper is accepted for publication
