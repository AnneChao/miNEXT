# miNEXT
Mixed iNEXT

The spider abundance data used in the code as an example were taken from Thorn et al. (2017); The bird incidnce data were taken from Thorn et al. (2016). 

miNEXT includes ten files: 
(1) bird.txt: incidence data.
(2) Spider: abundnce data.
(3) Abundance.R: main code for abundance data to compute and plot mixture of two rarefaction/extrapolation curves, and the numbers of   shared and unique species in any mixed sample of two rarefaction curves. An abundance example is also included.
(4) Incidence.R: main code for incidence data to compute and plot mixture of two rarefaction/extrapolation curves, and the numbers of   shared and unique species in any mixed sample of two rarefaction curves. An incidence example is also included.
(5) plot_function.R: functions used to plot the outcome of Abundance.R/Incidence.R
(6) function_abun.cpp: all cpp functions used in Abundacne.R.
(7) function_inci.cpp: all cpp functions used in Incidence.R.
(8) Abundance_subfunction.R: all subfunctions used in Abundacne.R.
(9) JADE.R: functions used in the extrapolation part of abundance and incidence data.
(10) bootstrap_p.R: functions used to compute confidence interval.

More details will be given when Chao et al. (2019) is accepted for publication
