Mixed iNEXT

The spider abundance data used in the code as an example were taken from Thorn et al. (2017); The bird incidnce data were taken from Thorn et al. (2016). 

The code includes six files: 
(1) bird.txt: incidence data.
(2) Spider: abundnce data.
(3) abundance.R: main code for abundance data to compute and plot mixture of two rarefaction and extrapolation curves, and the numbers of   shared and unique species in any mixed sample.
(4) incidence.R: main code for incidence data to compute and plot mixture of two rarefaction and extrapolation curves, and the numbers of   shared and unique species in any mixed sample.
(5) function_abun.cpp: all functions used in abundacne.R.
(6) function_inci.cpp: all functions used in incidence.R. 

More details will be given when Chao et al. (2019) is accepted for publication
